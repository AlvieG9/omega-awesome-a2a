# AI Explorer: Mistral Integration

This project integrates Mistral, a state-of-the-art AI model, with the ai-explorer application. Users can now select between OpenAI and Mistral models for generating prompt responses. The integration includes updated setup instructions, performance benchmarks, and a comparison of the two models.
Installation Instructions

Explain how to set up the environment, including both OpenAI and Mistral models.

## Model Comparison

This section compares OpenAI and Mistral across various metrics:

| Metric             | OpenAI   | Mistral |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Latency            | 100ms    | 85ms    |
| Response Quality   | High     | Very High|
| Cost per Token     | $0.02    | $0.015  |

Full comparison details can be found in the [comparison spreadsheet](link_to_comparison_spreadsheet).
Performance Testing

Provide a summary of the performance testing results.
Example:

markdown
Copy code
## Performance Testing

We tested both models with various types of prompts to measure latency, response quality, and cost. The results are documented in the [performance testing report](link_to_testing_report).
Demo Video

Include a link to the demo video you recorded.
